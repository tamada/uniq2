# uniq2

Delete duplicated lines.

[GNU core utilities](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/) has `uniq` command for deleting duplicate lines.
However, `uniq` command deletes only continuous duplicate lines.
When deleting not continuous duplicate lines, we use `sort` command together, in that case, the order of the list was not kept.

We want to delete not continuous duplicated lines with remaining the order.
